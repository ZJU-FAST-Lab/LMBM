# LMBM
Nonsmooth Unconstrained Optimization via Limited Memory Bundle Method

# Feature

1. The solver is a __C++11__ wrapper for the Fortran solver [LMBM](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-006-0728-2), which suits __Large-Scale Nonsmooth Unconstrained Nonlinear Optimization__.

2. It is a substitution to [L-BFGS](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/LBFGS-Lite) when nonsmooth optimization is unavoidable. For example, nonsmoothness is quite common in various robotics applications where spatially discretized data is often incorporated into optimization problem.
